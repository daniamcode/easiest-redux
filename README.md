from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD3miHerQbY

1.Create index.html with an input, a button, and a div to display a list of "to-do's"  
2.Add redux script to index.html  
3.Install Live Server extension in VS Code  
4.Right click on index.html and click "Open with Live Server"  
5.Create a redux.js javascript file (see the comments there)  
6.Add the reference to this file in index.html (<script src="redux.js"></script> )
